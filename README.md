Hello! My name is Lauren!

I am Irish and Belgian but grew up in Cork, Ireland. 
Currently, I live in the Netherlands to pursue the MSc Aerospace Engineering study specialising in Control & Simulation. 
I am a drone pilot and look forward to building my first racing/freestyle drone.
I also enjoy rock/metal music and anything fantasy related!
